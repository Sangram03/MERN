### 🌐 What is a CDN?

**CDN** stands for **Content Delivery Network**.

It is a **network of distributed servers** located around the world that deliver content (like CSS, JavaScript, images, videos) to users **faster and more efficiently** by serving it from a location close to the user.

### 🧠 In Simple Terms:

A **CDN is like a global delivery system for web assets**. Instead of downloading files from a single server, a CDN fetches them from the closest server to your location — reducing load time.

### ✅ Example in HTML: Using Bootstrap via CDN

```html
<!-- CSS from Bootstrap CDN -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- JS Bundle (includes Popper) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
